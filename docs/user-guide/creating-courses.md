# Creating Courses in Mindsmith

Courses in Mindsmith help you organize multiple lessons into a cohesive learning path. Whether you're delivering a full onboarding sequence or a structured training series, this guide walks you through the complete process of building and publishing a course.

## 📘 1. What Is a Course in Mindsmith?

A **course** is a container for multiple lessons. Unlike standalone lessons, courses allow you to:

- Group related lessons together  
- Set completion order  
- Create a more comprehensive learning experience

> Think of a course as a playlist of lessons with structure and flow.
