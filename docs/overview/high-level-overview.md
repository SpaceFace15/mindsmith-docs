# High-Level Overview

Welcome to the Mindsmith Documentation! This page provides a high-level overview of Mindsmith, an AI-powered course creation tool designed to help educators, instructional designers, and content creators develop engaging learning experiences efficiently.

Mindsmith is similar in concept to tools like Rise360, but with a distinctive edge—it uses AI to generate storyboards and turn them into complete lessons that are embedded within courses. These courses can be customized for interactivity, making them suitable for both self-paced learners and instructor-led environments. By using AI to automate routine instructional design work, Mindsmith allows users to focus more on creativity and learning outcomes rather than time-consuming development. It’s ideal for anyone who wants to streamline the course creation process while still maintaining a high level of customization and educational value.

- **Interactive Content**: Choose the interactivity level to match your learner's needs—from simple informational cards to dynamic questions and media.
- **Import Capabilities**: You can import lessons from other platforms like Rise360 or even use video inputs.

Mindsmith’s key features are designed to be intuitive while still offering powerful customization options. Whether you're building a single microlearning module or a full curriculum, the tools adapt to your workflow.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Create a New Course**: Begin by clicking “New Course” and choosing to either start from scratch or use an AI prompt.
2. **Enter Your Prompt**: The AI will generate a storyboard based on your input.
3. **Edit Lessons**: Customize each generated lesson—add or remove content, adjust media, and set interaction types.
4. **Structure the Course**: Combine multiple lessons and arrange their sequence.
5. **Preview and Share**: Test your course in preview mode and share it publicly or with collaborators.

This workflow is optimized for speed and scalability. Users can go from an idea to a finished course in minutes. The structure promotes iterative development—meaning you can revise lessons anytime while maintaining consistency across your course. This step-by-step approach is designed to minimize friction while maximizing creativity, ensuring even first-time users can build polished lessons with ease. With built-in autosaving and intuitive tools, Mindsmith makes it easy to keep your content fresh and up to date.
