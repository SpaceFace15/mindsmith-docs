## 2. Create a New Course

From your dashboard, click the **‚Äú+ Create Course‚Äù** button in the top right corner. This will prompt you to name your course and optionally add a description for better organization.

Courses serve as containers for your lessons and allow you to organize your content by topic, audience, or training goal. You can always rename or reconfigure your course later. This initial setup makes it easy to manage and scale your content as you develop more material over time.

## 3. Use AI to Generate a Lesson

Once your course is created, you‚Äôll be prompted to generate your first lesson. Enter a lesson topic or learning objective into the provided field. Then, select your desired interactivity level‚Äîsuch as multiple choice quizzes, short-form simulations, or simple content delivery‚Äîand click **‚ÄúGenerate Lesson.‚Äù**

Mindsmith‚Äôs AI will use your input to create an instructional storyboard complete with learning steps and interactive elements. This auto-generated content can be edited at any time, making it perfect for prototyping ideas or scaling your production process with minimal effort.

## 4. Edit and Customize the Lesson

After generation, the lesson opens in the visual editor. You can click on any part of the lesson‚Äîtext, quizzes, media, or structure‚Äîto edit it. Changes are saved automatically, and the editor is intuitive enough for both beginners and experienced instructional designers.

Use the left-hand panel to manage steps and flow, and the right-hand editing pane to change content. This is where your creativity comes into play‚Äîyou can tailor each lesson to match the tone, depth, and engagement style of your audience, whether it's students, employees, or public learners.

## 5. Preview Your Course

To make sure your lesson looks and functions as expected, click the **‚ÄúPreview‚Äù** button at the top of the editor. This will open an interactive learner view that mirrors what end-users will see when the course is published.

Previewing is essential for checking navigation flow, quiz logic, and overall presentation before sharing the course externally. It's also a helpful step when reviewing your edits before finalizing the structure. You‚Äôll be able to toggle through lessons, test interactions, and ensure your content flows as intended.

## 6. (FINALLY!) Publish and Share

When your lesson is ready to share, click the **‚ÄúPublish‚Äù** button in the top menu. Mindsmith will provide you with a public link to your course that can be shared via email, embedded into a website, or posted in a learning management system (LMS).

Publishing makes your course available to learners outside the platform, and Mindsmith tracks engagement and completion metrics to help you evaluate success. You can update your content after publishing, and learners will always see the latest version. This allows for iterative improvements and real-time refinements even after launch.
