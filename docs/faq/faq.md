# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses the most common questions new users have when using Mindsmith. If you're just getting started, we recommend reviewing the [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.md) first. For more detailed guidance, refer to the [User Guide](../user-guide/creating-lessons.md).

## ❓ Is Mindsmith free to use?

Yes, Mindsmith offers a free plan that allows users to explore the platform and generate lessons with limited monthly credits. This is ideal for testing the interface and building a few lessons without an upfront cost. 

If you need additional features, such as more credits, branding options, or enhanced publishing tools, Mindsmith offers premium plans for individuals and teams. You can compare plans in your account settings.



---

## ❓ What are credits and how are they used?

Credits are used to generate lessons using Mindsmith's AI tools. Each AI-generated lesson typically uses one credit, depending on complexity and selected interactivity level.

Your credit balance is shown in the top-right corner of the dashboard. When you run out of credits, you’ll need to wait for your monthly reset or purchase additional credits via a paid subscription.



---

## ❓ Can I edit lessons after they’ve been generated?

Absolutely. All AI-generated lessons can be fully edited in the visual editor. You can modify text, change quiz types, delete steps, reorder content, and even switch templates—all from within your course dashboard.

Mindsmith is designed to support both auto-generation and manual fine-tuning, so feel free to customize your content as much as you need.



---

## ❓ How do I preview what learners will see?

You can preview any lesson by clicking the **“Preview”** button in the top navigation bar. This opens the course in a learner-facing view so you can experience it as your audience would.

Previewing is highly recommended before publishing—it lets you confirm flow, interactivity, and visual layout before sharing externally.



---

## ❓ How do I publish or share my lesson?

When your lesson is ready, click **“Publish”** and Mindsmith will provide you with a public share link. You can send this link to learners, embed it in a website, or use it within an LMS.

You can continue editing your lesson after publishing—any updates you make will be reflected in real-time. This makes it easy to keep your courses current without needing to re-share links.



---

## ❓ Can I use templates to style my lessons?

Yes. Mindsmith includes a variety of templates that change the visual layout and instructional style of your lesson. You can apply or switch templates at any time during or after lesson creation.

Templates help you maintain visual consistency and tailor the tone or format to different use cases, such as onboarding, compliance, or training.



---

## ❓ What happens if I run out of credits?

If your credit balance reaches zero, you will no longer be able to generate new AI-based lessons. However, you can continue editing and publishing lessons you've already created.

To generate more lessons, you’ll either need to wait for your monthly credit reset (on the free plan) or upgrade to a paid plan that includes more credits.



---

## ❓ Can I collaborate with others?

Currently, Mindsmith supports solo authorship, but team-based collaboration features are planned for future releases. For now, you can export or share links to your published lessons, but simultaneous in-platform editing isn’t available.

Check the Mindsmith roadmap or announcements for updates on collaboration tools and upcoming features.
